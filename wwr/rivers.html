                                Given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because
                                of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the 
                                river that they never left.

                                Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep
                                are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa
                                pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun 
                                or rain when needed.

                                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
                                undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
                                and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
                                good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the 
                                late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
                            the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs,
                            beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs
                            from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
                            scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human 
                            activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

                                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make 
                                one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating 
                                whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river. <br>
                                The Grand Canyon is the Mecca of river runs with over 160 rapids, some 25+ ft drops,
                                and river speeds upwards of 20 mph. Thereâ€™s no doubt that a journey into the greatest
                                canyon in the West will be an epic adventure.

                            river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating
