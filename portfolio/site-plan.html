        [<b>Presentation</b><br>

        and I will give myself the task of demonstrating that I am the best option to meet the need that

        the values that have forged me throughout my life, I am 40 years old, married with two children, my family
        has been one of the engines that have led me to prepare myself in various areas in the labor field.<br>
        The spiritual and religious field is for me of utmost importance, in which I have developed experience as a 
        leader, friend, companion, guide, teacher and it has made me a human being with a greater understanding of 
        the importance of helping, believing and having faith in humanity and in the creator.]

        The desire to help others and achieve positive results for the personal and work life of people who
         develop in a professional work or personal environment, led me to develop in teaching through assertive
