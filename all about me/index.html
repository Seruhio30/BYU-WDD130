        <p> Throughout my life, I always try to help people, I'm 40 years old retired mountain rescuer, and I was a
            volunteer in many institutions
            like Cruz Roja, Bomberos de Costa Rica, and the Police Department.
            I know about many professions like electronic technician, industrial electricity, air conditioning, welding,
            professional ambulance driver, and truck driver, and the list continues, I speak 5 different languages, not
            to
            100% but I can have a basic conversation. My dream is living of this in a next future.
